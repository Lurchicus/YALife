Yet Another Life Program (based on Conway's Game of Life) by Dan Rhea
I wrote this to try out WinForms on the VS 2022 Preview (now RC 1).

I added the ability to scale a life "cell" from 1 to 16. This means
that a scale of 4 will draw a live cell that is 4 pixels high and 4
pixels wide. It can be thought of as a zoom.

As with most of my public GitHub repositories, I'm licensing this
program under the GPL 3 license.
